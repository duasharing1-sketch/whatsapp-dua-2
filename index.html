This powerful dua calls upon Allah ﷻ — by His Names Al-Ghafūr (The Most Forgiving), Ar-Raḥmān (The Most Merciful), and Al-Mannān (The Generous Bestower) — to forgive us for all injustices and wrongs we may have caused others, whether knowingly or unknowingly. It seeks His infinite bounty for those we have wronged, and His encompassing mercy for us. Because true repentance includes making right what we have harmed.

As Rasulullah ﷺ said: 

“Whoever wrongs his brother with regard to his honor or anything else, let him seek his pardon before the Day comes when there will be no dinar or dirham...” 

*Ya Allah (O Allah), Ya Ghafūr (O Most Forgiving), Ya Raḥmān (O Most Merciful), Ya Mannān (O Generous Bestower), we deeply regret, and desperately seek Your forgiveness for all forms of Ẓulm (oppression and injustice) we may have committed against any of Your servants. We ask that You grant them from Your infinite bounty which is never diminished, and we plead that You honor us with Your mercy which encompasses all things.*

This dua is part of *The Supplication of Infinite Blessings* — a powerful collection of heartfelt supplications designed to benefit you in both this life and the next. 

*At Dua Sharing, our mission is simple*: 

To encourage sincere dua, meaningful sharing, and to multiply blessings through a growing global chain of people making dua for one another every single day.

As Rasulullah ﷺ said: 

“The supplication of a Muslim for his brother in his absence will certainly be answered. Every time he makes a supplication for good for his brother, the angel appointed for this task says: ‘Ameen! And may it be for you too.”

Every post we share is taken directly from the full Supplication of Infinite Blessings — with the aim of moving hearts, inspiring action, and reminding us all of what truly matters.

When you share this post, you’re not simply sharing a dua. You’re opening the door to millions of people making sincere dua for you — with the Malaika (Angels) themselves saying “Ameen” to every single one.

May Allah accept it from you, and reward you for all those it reaches through you.

Ameen`;
